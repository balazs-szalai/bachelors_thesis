# Packages
## helium_old
A lesser known package, wrapper of the dataset obtained in Russell J. Donnelly, and Carlo F. Barenghi - The Observed Properties of Liquid Helium at the Saturated Vapor Pressure.
Its description is in the file. Disclaimer: this is not my work, I'm just not sure if this specific package is standardly available, therefor for completeness it is provided here.

## sparse
The name might be confusing. It as a part of a package I wrote, the unnecessary files are stripped. The key use of this is for the simplistic lock-in emulator and setting the float type for taichi.

## praktikum_package
Contains my package for simple error propagation calculations and for other tasks  relevant for the course Praktikum at MFF UK. 
It also contains its own description. The original with examples can be found at https://github.com/balazs-szalai/praktikum.
